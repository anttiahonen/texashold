  <h2> 
    Specification of requirements
  </h2> 
  <p> 
    In this section, specify the requirements for your project that you are fulfilling.
    The requirements that you choose must cover the minimum requirements for your project work topic.
    Be sure to make a distinction between the mandatory requirements for the project and any additional requirements that you have that are not critical for the project.
  </p> 
  <p> 
    Do not describe the technical details of your project but rather, what functionality and features the project provides for the potential user.
  </p> 
  <h2> 
    Program architecture
  </h2> 
  <p> 
    This section describes how you intend to fulfill the requirements specified in the previous section.
    The high-level architecture of your program should be described in this section by the use of some form of diagrams.
    The diagrams need not be in UML, they should clarify and summarise the structure of your project.
    Depending on your topic, you might want to describe the structure and operation of your project separately.
  </p> 
  <p> 
    Do not write source code here.
    If absolutely necessary, you can include some parts of your interfaces or the core classes here, but the amount of source code should be kept to a minimum.
  </p> 
  <p> 
    Include a short rationale or a discussion concerning the architectural decisions that you had to make.
    Especially alternative solutions to the key problems and possible compromises that had to be made in the design phase.
  </p> 
  <h2> 
    Task sharing
  </h2> 
  <p> 
    Describe, in this section, how all the tasks necessary for the implementation of the project are to be shared.
    All members of your group should have a roughly equal share in programming.
  </p> 
  <p> 
    Additionally describe the methods of co-operation and the specification of interfaces necessary for the the implementation of the various parts of the project by each group member.
  </p> 
  <h2> 
    Testing
  </h2> 
  <p> 
    Describe how the individual parts of the program and how the complete project will eventually be tested.
  </p> 
  <h2> 
    Schedule
  </h2> 
  <p> 
    Include a rough schedule for your project.
    Do not go into excessive detail but construct clear milestones and deadlines for your work.
  </p> 
  <h2> 
    External libraries
  </h2> 
  <p> 
    This is essentially a list of all external libraries that you intend to use.
  </p>
